# Game Theoretic Approach to Brain Cancer: An Evolutionary Game Theory-Based Investigation with RNN-driven Models
Present a strategic modeling approach to brain cancer evolution and treatment strategies. Specifically, we address the critical tradeoff between administering a high dose to eliminate cancer cells and minimizing harm to healthy cells. Our chosen framework, based on evolutionary game theory, effectively captures the dynamics of cell interactions, and we employ recurrent neural networks to predict the population sizes during treatment. The research delves into the intricate interactions within the tumor microenvironment, trying to explore optimal treatment strategies that account for the strategic behaviors of cancer cells in response to therapy intensity.
